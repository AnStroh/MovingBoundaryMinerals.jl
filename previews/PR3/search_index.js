Furthermore, the code works with SI units. Subsequently, users are asked to adjust their values or to change the units consequently at their own risk.Most of the codes are created to handle diffusion couples. In these codes we always refer to the left (phase A) and right side (phase B). If two numbers are stored in a variable, the first refers to the left material and the second to the right material. We have also stored generally valid codes in the maincodes folder. The examples can be found in the examples folder. Parameters in the maincodes folder have no physical meaning and act as placeholders such that the code works out of the box. In contrast, the examples show codes with real or non-dimensional values.","category":"page"},{"location":"man/general_remarks/#Compositions-and-concentrations","page":"General Remarks","title":"Compositions and concentrations","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"man/general_remarks/","page":"General Remarks","title":"General Remarks","text":"In our Julia package MOBILE.jl, we specify the concentration in mol.

The same also applies to diffsion processes in single crystals. However, there is one exception. Within ChemicalStefanproblem.jl, the diffusivities are implemented as constant values.  Within example D1, we specify the diffusion coefficient for Fe-Mg in olivine and in the melt based on experimental values (Dohmen and Chakraborty, 2007a, b; Zhang and Cherniak, 2010) and effective evaluations (Crank, 1975).

Therefore, it is necessary to describe the equilibrium conditions at the interface. Equations for the phase transformation lines contain all thermodynamically important data. These equations can be described by a quadratic equation (Eq. 1). Within our code, two transformation lines are always required to determine the composition of the components at the edges of a stable assemblage fields. The user needs to define coefficients (a, b, c) for both transformation lines as input prior to the start of the model.","category":"page"},{"location":"man/digitalization/#Work-flow","page":"Digitization","title":"Work flow","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"man/digitalization/","page":"Digitization","title":"Digitization","text":"We have used the PlotDigitizer.jl package in Julia (Stroh and Frasunkiewicz, 2025) (https://github.com/AnStroh/PlotDigitizer.jl, version v0.1.0) to digitize the phase diagram. A shortened version of the package can be found in the additionalcodes folder under digitizePlot.jl. The package can be used to digitize reaction lines and export the X-T coordinates. The coordinates can then be used to calculate the coefficients for the reaction lines. We provide a short guideline here. First, the user defines the pathway of the image of the phase diagram (.png or .jpg file) as a variable. It is important that the image only shows the phase diagram (like here: examples\\Examplesphasediagram\\OlPhasediagramwithoutframework.png) and has no border. The phase diagram should show the composition on the x-axis and the temperature on the y-axis. Next, the user is asked for the limits of the axis, which should be defined in XBC and YBC. Afterwards, the user can run the function digitizePlot(XBC,YBC,filename) to set or delete points of lines, switch the line and extract coordinates. Using CalculateReactionLine.jl, the coefficient of: X(T)=aT^2+bT+c              (1) where X is the composition the phase transition, T is the temperature in K and a, b and c depict the coefficients defining the quadratic equation, which can be calculated with the least squares method and subsequently stored.  However, this step can be skipped, if the coefficients are known. In this case, the user can enter the coefficients directly in the main code.","category":"page"},{"location":"man/authors/#Authors","page":"Authors","title":"Authors","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"man/authors/","page":"Authors","title":"Authors","text":"MOBILE.jl's development is coordinated by a group of principal developers, who are also its main contributors and who can be contacted in case of questions about MOBILE.jl.
