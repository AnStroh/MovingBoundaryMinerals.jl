# MovingBoundaryMinerals.jl
MovingBoundaryMinerals.jl is a software to model diffusion-controlled growth/resorption processes in mineral couples. 
We tested our software with various analytical and semi-analytical solutions (examples A1-A2, B1-B5, C1). In addition, we present some mineral growth/resorption examples (B6-B7, C2, D1) showing compositional profiles, which can be observed in natural samples.
