# List of examples
Examples with the letter A refer to diffusion models in a single material, while examples with letter B and C refer to a diffusion couple. In B the model uses flux conditions to describe the interface whereas the models labelled C perform total mass balance calculations. Examples with letter D describe the thermodynamically constrained crystal growth/resorption. However, we have some more examples included, which show the stepwise increasing complexity of the codes. They have names without any reference letter.
